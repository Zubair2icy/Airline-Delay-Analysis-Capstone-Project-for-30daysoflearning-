# Airline-Delay-Analysis-Capstone-Project-for-30daysoflearning-
This is my submission for my capstone project. It includes in it a report of exploratory and diagnostic analysis on airline delays

# Introduction:
The 30 days of learning is an initiative stated by Olanrewaju Oyinbooke (on Twitter @theOyinbooke), a Microsoft senior cloud advocate and his team wherein they sought to empower students with in demand skills in technology.
The program has three tracks which are:
 ✓ Data Analysis with Power BI
 ✓ Data Science and Machine Learning
 ✓ Power platform and low or no-code development
To follow our learning track on Twitter, you can simply use the hashtag #30daysoflearning. If you wish to learn any of these, you may register for the program here.
After 22 days of learning data analysis we were given a project which includes the airline Delay project, to which tbis submission is been made.

According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy.
More than half of that amount comes from the pockets of passengers who not only lose time waiting for their planes to leave, but they also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded.
This report seeks to explore the possible Impacts of this delays and also some possible causes.

# Problem Statement:
This project seeks to answer the following questions:
1. What has been the history of delayed flights?
2. Any identified pattern with the delayed flights?
3. What could be the possible causes of flight delay?
4. What possible recommendations can help solve this problem?
